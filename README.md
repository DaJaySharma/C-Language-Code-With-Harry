# C-Language-Code-With-Harry

I have already completed the first 5 chapters of my C programming journey. However, I realized that learning in public can be a great way to stay motivated, get feedback, and connect with fellow programmers.

So, for the next 5 chapters, I will be coding while actively pushing my progress to GitHub. The previous chaptersâ€™ code will also be uploaded as separate folders for reference.

Repository Structure

01-previous-chapters/ â†’ Contains code from the first 5 chapters.

02-new-chapters/ â†’ Live coding & learning for the remaining 5 chapters.

ðŸ”¥ Why I'm Doing This
Accountability â€“ Staying consistent in learning.

Sharing Knowledge â€“ Helping others who are also learning C.

Getting Feedback â€“ Improving by learning from the community.
